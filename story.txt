I landed at Flughafen in Berlin.
I got in my BMW to go back listening to Du Hast by Rammstein.
I stopped by the market to buy some bratwurst.
Then I stopped at the Baeckerei to get Gebaeck and Apfelkuchen.
While standing in line, I realized that I had left me lederhose at home.
I wasn't wearing appropriate attire to stop at the Biergarten on my return.
